/*
==============================================
     TRTS SYSTEM CREED – RATIONAL ONLY
==============================================

- All propagation must remain strictly within the rational field ℚ.
- No operation may simplify, normalize, reduce, fit, scale, or apply GCD to any value.
- `mpq_canonicalize()` is strictly forbidden and must never be used.
- All propagation must use raw integer numerator/denominator tracking.
- Any evaluation to floating-point must be snapshot-only for analysis.
  These values must NEVER influence state, behavior, or propagation.
- Rational form must preserve its full historical tension; no compression.
- Zero-crossings, sign changes, and stack depth are all meaningful logic.
- Nothing shall "optimize" away the very thing we are trying to study.

Violation of these principles invalidates all results. There are no exceptions.
